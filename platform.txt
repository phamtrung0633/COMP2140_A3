The platform that this app is developed in EXPO, and tested in Iphones

THERE ARE SOME SPECIAL NOTICES FOR MY ASSIGNMENT, PLEASE READ...

1. Due to the code used to ask for user's location permission and track user 's location 
from the contact has issue, it results in a situation where I am able to fix all problems
however you can only allow permission "ONCE" instead of "ALWAYS/WHILE USING APP" to make
it work. Meaning when asked location permission, PLEASE choose "Allow Once" instead of "ALWAYS" or
"WHILE USING APP", otherwise the permission fetched for next time opening the app WILL NOT be "Allowed"
even thought "Always"/"While using app" is chosen. I have not been able to figure out this problem, and more
importantly Aneesha on an ED post has allowed me to do this and she is ok with this because it is mainly
due to the contact's code being erronous for EXPO. 
Therefore PLEASE CHOOSE "ALLOW ONCE" whenever asked for location permission

2. I have not put a lot of data into the API "sampletolocation" therefore to make it easy when testing,
set the simulator position to be 
Latitude: -27.464782
Longitude: 153.029858
This is the only location the has songs within at the moment in my API
Feel free to add more songs to my API's locations, with a special notice,
when adding songs to locations, you should add the songs that already existed and created in my API's songs,
as I store songs in a different format...

3. The app was tested and develop with IPHONE 13 and IPHONE 15, I have not tested the layout
of the app in different Iphones, this may result in the app's layout being different or not User-friendly
in other phones as this course does not focus on CSS and I am not confident about my CSS's styling based on pixels, etc.
